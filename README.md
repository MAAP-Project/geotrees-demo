# Biomass Reference Map Generation using STAC and COPC 

This tutorial is divided into three scripts based on types of data used for processing as follows-

1. Python script for LAS files to COPC conversion - `convert_las_to_copc.py`
2. R notebook for Biomass Reference Map Generation based on COPC data ingested to MAAP STAC - `biomass_reference_map_v2.ipynb`
3. Python notebook for visualization of Canopy Cover LAS files along with Biomass Map generated in 2. and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) terrain map - `lonboard-viz.ipynb`
